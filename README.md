What Is Windows Mark of the Web (MoTW)?
Mark of the Web (MoTW) is a security feature in Microsoft Windows that marks files downloaded from the Internet or other potentially unsafe locations as potentially risky. 
This mark is used by Windows and supported applications to help protect users from inadvertently running malicious files.

**Zone Identifier: This stream contains a ZoneId value that indicates the fileâ€™s origin:**

0 = My Computer
1 = Local intranet
2 = Trusted sites
3 = Internet
4 = Restricted sites
------------
**Why is it important?**
Security Filtering: Windows uses it to warn or block dangerous file types.
SmartScreen: Prevents execution of unknown files from the internet.
Group Policy Rules: Organizations can enforce behavior based on this zone info.
Unblocking Files: Sometimes files are marked unsafe (e.g., .exe, .chm, .ps1).
